# nemiss_pbl
nemiss neutrino emission from hydrocode data describing a simulated stellar binary system. 

Update: 201123 

A whole folder of the pipeline run PLUTO-nemiss-rlos has now been uploaded, minus the sim data of course. 

It resides in the current repo. 

It includes a folder with the three files needed to run a pluto sim, this one at the neutrino scale. These also exist in the main run folder, torblob18dummies. 

There, also reside the numerous .pro files that accompany PLUTO.

Furthermore, the userdef_output.c modified PLUTO file is there, with the modification to produce required PLUTO dummy data files, that shall act as containers for the output of nemiss.

rlos also resides in torblob18dummies folder. 

nemiss' and rlos' external param files are also there.

Please seek the latest versions of files, these are mostly named after their creation date. Please note that minor upgrades were made, e.g. nemiss091123 fixes a bug in relation to TR11 relativistic conversion of a hot proton power-law particle distribution.

More to come here!
